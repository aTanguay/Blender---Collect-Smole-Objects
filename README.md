# Blender_Collect_Smole_Objects
 A simple blender addon that will collect up object smaller than the currently seleted object.

This addon is maninly useful for people who have to deal with CAD data collections like car UDMs.
Often times these collections come in with a lot of parts you don't need because they fell through the cracks or something when someone eas exporting...things like screws and springs and whatnot that you won't see. Sometimes these can be very dense, adding bulk that you don't want, and/or can't afford in your scene.

To use the addon, install as usual. Once installed, you will find it in the 'View' menu in the main 3D interface.
At the end of the menu, after a separator you should see 'Collect Smaller Objects'. 

Select ONE mesh obeject in your scene. Everything smaller than this object will be automatically placed into a collection called 'Littles'. So, select your object, run 'Collect Smaller Objects'. This collection will also be automatically hidden. Objects are still there, but they're hidden in this collection.

That's it. You can run the script again, and it will automatically place new objects in that collection. So, you can start small and work your way up and see what effect it's having on your scene.

(Once again, a sweet ChatGPT joint, featuring me. Yes, it may destroy us all, but for now, neat.)
